# First workshop of exercises C++

In this folder, you will find the solution of the workshop including a presentation and documentation of each one of the programs that were made by me. 

To compile the programs:
* If you are on Windows, you need to install MinGW64 to compile it or get a IDE that understand C++ like Dev C++
* If your are on linux or  Mac, you can compile with g++ compiler: '''g++ filename.cpp -o outputfile'''
